why the knicks don't win rings: 
stern is still alive obvious 
(think new jersey for a second
won't ya all metv toonworld 
spin-off reality soap) 
and made an oath no rings 
so no championship riot with the 
new york stock exchange 
oldest fixer 
families going back
to the 1800s.
so there's a chance? yea coz alex rider
the book series. knicks are gonna 
win a ring "the fix".
i put in so much work in nyc 
in 2025 that its
a riot coming 
(elliot smith reference).
