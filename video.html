life is constant extortion - "a ball representing music" performance art december 6th, 2023 

set-list (there were some deviations and improvisations of course from this set list): 

- a ball representing music - playing music with chords (whip it)
 - playing music with harmony (hold the ball in silence) 
- remix music (slice the ball open turn it inside out tape it up and label it music) 
- sell music (write on apiece of paper $1 to myself , hold it up, place it in the chair where it is and take the ball) 
- (burn the dollar)
 - take many pieces of paper crumple them up and put stickers that say music on it put them on chair and put a $1 bill handwritten on paper on chair, throw the crumpled paper to the crowd, give the $1 handwritten paper into a cup of water and let it dissolve 

post-set list notes : bucket of water turned to be my “liquidity” to clear my assets. i did not wind up burning the dollar to ensure safety of everyone. chords to play music with wound up being, in fact, power chords. audience was more positive about experience than i expected
